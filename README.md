# React Stunning UI Template

`react-stunning-ui-template` is a starter project for building visually stunning and modular web applications with React and TypeScript. This template is equipped with modern UI libraries, including Tailwind CSS for responsive styling, Framer Motion for animations, and Headless UI for accessible components. It’s optimized for a scalable, component-based architecture following atomic design principles.

## Features

- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing for better code quality, readability, and error handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development and responsive design.
- **Framer Motion**: Powerful library for smooth, complex animations.
- **Heroicons and react-icons**: Icons library for scalable vector icons.
- **Headless UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI components for creating custom-styled widgets.
- **Clean Code & Atomic Design**: Organized folder structure for scalability and modularity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/react-stunning-ui-template.git
   cd react-stunning-ui-template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Tailwind CSS**
   Tailwind CSS is already configured in this project. You can customize `tailwind.config.js` if needed.

4. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Project Structure

```

├── assets                # Images, fonts, and other static assets
├── components            # Reusable UI components following atomic design
│   ├── atoms             # Basic elements like buttons, inputs
│   ├── molecules         # Combined components, e.g., forms, cards
│   ├── organisms         # Complex components like navigation bars, modals
├── pages                 # Top-level pages (e.g., LandingPage.tsx)
├── styles                # Global styles and Tailwind configuration
└── App.tsx               # Main application component
```

### Dependencies and Configuration

- **Tailwind CSS**: Installed and configured for responsive styling.
- **Framer Motion**: For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Headless UI**: Accessible components for dropdowns, modals, and more.
- **Heroicons and react-icons**: Icons library for scalable vector icons.

To customize Tailwind CSS, modify `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css` to adjust themes, colors, and responsive breakpoints.

### Usage

This template includes a single, minimal landing page with “Hello, World” centered on the screen. Customize the page as follows:

1. **Open `src/App.tsx`**: Modify the placeholder text and styling to start building your landing page or home page.
2. **Add Components**: Use the atomic design structure to create and organize components under `components/atoms`, `components/molecules`, and `components/organisms`.
3. **Style with Tailwind**: Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for consistent, responsive styling across all components.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase for consistent style and syntax.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the code using Prettier.

### Configuration and Customization

- **ESLint**: Configured to enforce consistent coding practices.
- **Prettier**: Automatically formats code for readability.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing and improves code quality.

To modify ESLint or Prettier configurations, edit `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` files as needed.

### Example: Adding a Component

1. **Create a Button Component**:
   - Inside `src/components/atoms/`, create `Button.tsx`.
   - Add placeholder code, then use Tailwind CSS classes for styling.

2. **Import and Use the Component**:
   - In `App.tsx` or any other file, import and use the component to build your page layout.

```typescript
import Button from './components/atoms/Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      <Button>Click Me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Roadmap

- Expand the component library with additional atoms, molecules, and organisms.
- Add example animations with Framer Motion.
- Implement additional accessible components using Headless UI.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request for any additions or improvements. All contributions should adhere to the code style enforced by ESLint and Prettier.
